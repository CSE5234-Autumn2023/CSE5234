# Project Overview
This is an enterprise web project.

# NOTE
- For post requests when sending a json with order items etc, send it in the request body.
- If you are only sending one word in the request params for example to search for an item id or name, just use a query string.
  You can see examples of how to use each in the api already.
- Also downloading and using Postman is a really easy way to test all of these requests before we start using them with the frontend,
  if you need help just text and I can send some pictures on how to use it.
